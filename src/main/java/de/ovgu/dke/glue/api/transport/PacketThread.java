/**
 * <p>
 * A packet thread represents a linear packet-flow between two peers. Each
 * packet must be assigned to a packet thread and multiple threads may be used
 * on a connection to represent multiple, distinct communication contexts
 * between two peers. To create a packet thread, a connection must be acquired
 * from a transport.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may not be thread safe. Packets on a packet
 * thread are processed subsequently and the thread context of a packet thread
 * instance changes depending on the processing party. Implementations of the
 * GLUE API must ensure that one packet thread instance is never called twice at
 * the same time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Packet threads are distinguished by their identifiers. The transport
 * implementation must take care to generate unique IDs and also may implement
 * mechanisms to determine if an ID is local, i.e. has been created by the
 * transport instance. Packet Threads are considered equal if their IDs are
 * equal.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @throws IllegalStateException
 *             if this packet thread or the underlying connection/transport are
 *             not in a state where they can process packets.
