 * A packet thread represents a linear packet-flow between two peers. Each

 * on a connection to represent multiple, distinct communication contexts
 * between two peers. To create a packet thread, a connection must be acquired
 * from a transport.
 * </p>

 * Implementations of this interface may not be thread safe. Packets on a packet
 * thread are processed subsequently and the thread context of a packet thread

 * GLUE API must ensure that one packet thread instance is never called twice at
 * the same time.
